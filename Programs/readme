# Set of programs for information mining on InSAR derived deformation maps

For python programs, please install necassary libraries using 
Use requirements.txt to install necessary libraries for the python programs. The requirements.txt file is available in the Programs directory.

Follow these steps:

In your shell (or command prompt)

(i) Go to the directory where requirements.txt is located (ii) activate your virtualenv (if you create a separate virtual envcironment for this program) (iii) run pip install -r requirements.txt

## Sequence of programs and usage

p01_time_series_unsupervised_clustering_rts.py: This program perform time series clustering for InSAR time series displacement using time series k-means algorithm

p02_Individual_cluster_dbscan_clustering.py: This program performs spatial clustering over individual temporal clusters detected using p01.

p03_plot_dbscan_clusters.m: A program for plotting the resulting clusters from p02. 

p03a_LSTM_supervised_classification_dbscan_out.py: Program for supervised classification using LSTM networks with clusters generated from results of p02 acting as training labels. 

p03b_LSTMP_supervised_classification_dbscan_out.py: Program for supervised classification using LSTM and perceptron networks with clusters generated from results of p02 acting as training labels.

p04_finding_spatial_correlation_lengths.m: Finding spatial correlation lengths for displacement in the study area, to find out a threshold for removing widespread unwanted clusters.

p05_spatial_dispersion.m: Finding spatial dispersion of individual clusters generated from p02. Those with large dispersions would be removed.
